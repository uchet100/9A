READ ME (PRODUCT AND DEVELOPMENT BASIC INFO DOCUMENTATION)
This is 9A's INSE product called 9Accountant
Developed as part of UoP's INSE coursework.

A desktop based application which allows people to clock into work,  keep track of their work hours and their expected pay for the month.

DISCLAIMER: This repository contains the basic prototype of the product. Functionality has been optimized and coded with simple-to-medium complexity, simply to allow whoever is intrested in the product to understand the prupose of it and the goals of the team; and to give a flavour of the expected long product life cycle. The development team is confident in the possibility that the product could become part of users everyday life in an efficient and simple way. Further details below.


From the beginning of the project, the aim of the team has been that of building a user friendly and simple application for basic administrative needs of workers (For example listing jobs they do, expected pay with taxes calculation embedded).
The scope of this initial version of the project has been redesigned based on time limitations and Prototype (V 1.0) has basic features implemented that grant the user the possibility to modify, calculate and monitor the most important things in their working life.

The advantage of building such an application lays in the possibility of long life (activity and mainteinability) of the project iself. Several other implementations can be applied in the future to: add more features , keep the calculations and the features updated with the current national working culture/laws , add more levels of user customization and many other features.
This grants the application the possibility to stay relevant in a constantly changing working environment, giving the user the possibility to use the same platform to handle work informations in the present and over the years to come. Creating trust between users/customers and the 9Accountant application (and development team).

IMPLEMENTATION OF GOOGLE CALENDAR: One possible future feature is the implementation of a calendar (probably by using Google API) to allow the user to insert working days and hours. The 9Accountant product will then communicate with Google API to allow even more personalization to the jobs info in the calendar (calulating pay and checking if the user's jobs list contains all the jobs that the calendar has scheduled)
